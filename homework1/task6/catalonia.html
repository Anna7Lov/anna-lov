        <p>Catalonia is an autonomous community of Spain, designated as a nationality by its Statute of Autonomy.</p>

        <p>Most of the territory (except the Val d'Aran) lies on the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, to the south of
            the Pyrenees mountain range. Catalonia is administratively divided into four provinces: Barcelona, Girona,
            Lleida, and Tarragona. The capital and largest city, Barcelona is the second-most populated municipality in
            Spain and the fifth-most populous urban area in the European Union. It comprises most of the former
            Principality of Catalonia (with the remainder Roussillon now part of France's Pyrénées-Orientales). It is
            bordered by France (Occitanie) and Andorra to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the east, and the Spanish
            autonomous communities of Aragon to the west and Valencia to the south. The official languages are Catalan,
            Spanish, and the Aranese dialect of Occitan.</p>
