        <p>Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club
            has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a
            club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most
            valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.76 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in
            terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the
            "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs. Barcelona traditionally play in dark
            shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.</p>

        <p>Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 75 trophies: 26 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, thirteen Supercopa de
            España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the
            latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won twenty European and worldwide
            titles: five UEFA Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA
            Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups. Barcelona was ranked
            first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009,
            2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies the sixth position on the UEFA club rankings as of July 2022. The
            club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El
            Clásico.</p>
